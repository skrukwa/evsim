        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering

        This algorithm's structure roughly follows the steps outlined below.

        STEP 1.
        Assign the root as one charge station which represents the cluster of all charge stations given
        (and all charge stations below it in the tree) by minimizing the average distance to all
        other charge stations.

        STEP 2.
        If all the charge stations are within the cluster distance specified then each charge
        station can be added as a child of root, and the root represents the cluster.
        Note that this implicitly covers len(charge_stations) == 1 since the distance would then be 0.

        Otherwise, the charge stations are then split into two groups and recursed on (meaning
        that this tree will be binary if we ignore leafs). This is done by picking the charge
        stations that are the furthest apart, and then dividing the charge stations into two groups
        depending based on the distance of each charge station to two chosen charge stations.
